        <ul>
        <p><i><h2>Intersting facts about flying-cicada:-</i></p></h3>
        <li><h3>They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Cicadas are great at clinging to tree trunks and making loud screeching sounds by vibrating their bodies. But these bulky, red-eyed insects aren't so great at flying. The reason why may lie in the chemistry of their wings, a new study shows.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Technically cicadas don't bite or sting; they do however pierce and suck. They might try to pierce and suck you, but don't worry, they aren't Vampires nor are they malicious or angry — they're just ignorant and think you're a tree. Drinking human blood would probably kill a cicada.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>The body of a cicada is similar to that of a violin or a guitar, in that much of it consists of empty, air-filled spaces that act like a resonating chamber and amplify the sound they generate.</h3></li>
